#HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM MANAGEMENT
Project is based on how priority is given to particular patient in emergency ward of hospital. We have used priority queue. A PriorityQueue in Java is a queue or collection of items in which elements are placed in order of their priority. When accessing elements, the element with the greatest priority is deleted first before the element with the lower priority.  In a hospital, the emergency department gives priority numbers to patients. The patient with the greatest priority gets checked up first.
A hospital emergency room does not see patients on a first-come first-served (FIFO) basis. Rather, the most urgent patients are seen before patients whose injuries are less severe or non-life-threatening. You will implement a priority queue such that patients with the most severe injuries are admitted before those who have less severe injury. For each patient in the priority queue, the following information is stored:
Name of patient.
Injury Severity: an integer, higher values represent higher priorities for admission.
Medical Problem
Operations performed are:
Admit a patient.
Discharge a patient
Check if empty beds are available
